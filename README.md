# üö¶ Intelligent Traffic Simulation

A TypeScript-based traffic intersection simulation that models realistic traffic light behavior at intersections.

## üáµüá± Polish Traffic Light System

This simulation follows the Polish traffic light sequence:

- üî¥ **Red** ‚Üí üü† **Red+Yellow** ‚Üí üü¢ **Green** ‚Üí üü° **Yellow** ‚Üí üî¥ **Red**

Unlike many other countries, Poland uses a **Red+Yellow** phase to prepare drivers for the upcoming green light, giving them time to prepare.

This simulation also assumes that during the yellow light phase, one last vehicle can still cross the intersection before the light turns red.

 ### **üö® Simulation Completion Notice**

 Due to the gradual nature of the traffic light system, some scenarios may require ADDITIONAL SIMULATION STEPS beyond the initial command sequence to allow all vehicles to completely clear the intersection. This is normal behavior that reflects the realistic Polish traffic light transitions (Red ‚Üí Red+Yellow ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red).

### Running Simulation

```bash
npm run simulation input.json output.json
npm run simulation <input.json> <output.json> <mode> (mode can be singleLane (default) or dualLane)
```

##  Traffic Logic

### Priority Calculation

The system evaluates directions using:

```
Combination Value = Œ£(waitingTime¬≤) for all vehicles in combination
```
This algorithm values not only number of the cars in a queue, but also their time, which for long waiting times increases combination value very quickly. <br/>
This prevents situations where a single vehicle from a side road gets stuck waiting for an extremely long time while a busy main road has continuous traffic flow.

## 1: Single Lane Intersections

### üõ£Ô∏è Conflict Intersections (Skrzy≈ºowania Kolizyjne)

This simulation models **conflict intersections** where vehicle paths cross each other. The most common conflict scenario is when:

- üöó **Vehicle A** drives straight through the intersection
- üöô **Vehicle B** from the opposite direction turns left, crossing Vehicle A's path

> **We assume that they follow standard traffic rules. They enter the intersection simulataneously, first the Vehicle A leaves the intersection and then Vehicle B.**

> **We also assume that no vehicle enters the intersection until the previous vehicle from their lane has completely cleared the intersection.**

This prevents gridlock and ensures smooth traffic flow even when paths cross. The simulation implements this by:

1. **Queue-based movement**: Only the first vehicle in each lane can move
2. **Complete clearance**: Vehicles must fully exit before the next can enter
3. **Conflict resolution**: Opposing straight and left-turn movements are coordinated

### üö¶ Single Lane Logic

Each road has exactly **one lane going to the intersection** that can accommodate vehicles going:

- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Straight** through the intersection
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Left** turn (crossing oncoming traffic)
- ‚Ü™Ô∏è **Right** turn (non-conflicting)
- üîÑ **U-Turn** (follows the same priority rules as left turns)

### üî¢ Priority Calculation for Single Lane Intersections

There are exactly **two possible outcomes** for Single Lane Intersections:

- üü¢ **North-South path is active**
- üü¢ **East-West path is active**

The combination value doesn't depend on where the cars are going, but **from which road they originate**.

#### North-South Combination Value:

```
North-South Value = Œ£(waitingTime¬≤) for all vehicles on north road +
                    Œ£(waitingTime¬≤) for all vehicles on south road
```

#### East-West Combination Value:

```
East-West Value = Œ£(waitingTime¬≤) for all vehicles on east road +
                  Œ£(waitingTime¬≤) for all vehicles on west road
```

The system compares these two values and activates the direction with the **higher priority score**.

## 2: Dual Lane Intersections

This simulation mode models intersections where vehicle paths DO NOT cross each other.

This time each road has two lanes entering the intersection:
- One for driving straight or turning right.
- The other one for turning left or doing a U-turn.

In this mode we have 4 combinations:
- 1,2 - Right lanes are active (of both North and South or East and West roads.), drivers can go straight or right from the active lanes.
- 3,4 - Left lanes are active (of both North and South or East and West roads.), drivers can turn left or do a U-turn from them, but also drivers from the perpendicular direction can turn right due to the active Green Right Arrow.

They can be seen clearly on this image, the missing two ones are those below, but rotated 90 degrees.

### Combination Values
Combination Values are calculated very similarily except this time we're counting waiting times squared on particular lanes not whole roads.

### Safety
This is a much safer intersection than a single-lane one, because it has no conflicting active paths. Green Right Arrows make it also more efficient. I also ensured in the code that even if the green arrow is active, if the first driver in the line wants to drive straight he must follow the red light.





## Input Format

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "type": "addVehicle",
      "vehicleId": "vehicle1",
      "startRoad": "north",
      "endRoad": "south"
    },
    {
      "type": "step"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Command Types:

- **`addVehicle`**: Adds a vehicle to the specified road

  - `vehicleId`: Unique identifier for the vehicle
  - `startRoad`: One of `"north"`, `"south"`, `"east"`, `"west"`
  - `endRoad`: Destination road (can be any direction)

- **`step`**: Advances the simulation by one time step

##  Output Format

```json
{
  "stepStatuses": [
    {
      "leftVehicles": ["vehicle1", "vehicle2"]
    },
    {
      "leftVehicles": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Each step records which vehicles successfully passed through the intersection.
